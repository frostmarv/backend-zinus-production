## üîÑ Logic Flow

### 1. NG (Reject) Calculation

```sql
ng_totals AS (
  SELECT 
    br.customer_po AS customerPO,
    br.sku,
    SUM(br.ng_quantity) AS ng_qty
  FROM bonding_reject br
  WHERE br.status != 'CANCELLED'
  GROUP BY br.customer_po, br.sku
)
```

**What it does:**
- Sum all NG quantities from `bonding_reject` table
- Exclude cancelled records
- Group by customer PO and SKU

### 2. Replacement Calculation

```sql
replacement_totals AS (
  SELECT 
    br.customer_po AS customerPO,
    br.sku,
    SUM(COALESCE(rp.processed_qty, 0)) AS replacement_qty
  FROM bonding_reject br
  LEFT JOIN replacement_progress rp ON br.id = rp.bonding_reject_id
  WHERE br.status != 'CANCELLED'
    AND rp.status IN ('IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED')
  GROUP BY br.customer_po, br.sku
)
```

**What it does:**
- Sum all processed replacement quantities
- Join `bonding_reject` with `replacement_progress`
- Only count IN_PROGRESS and COMPLETED replacements
- Exclude cancelled records

### 3. NG Active Calculation

```sql
ng_active = ng - replacement
```

**What it means:**
- **ng_active** = NG yang belum diganti
- If replacement > 0, NG berkurang
- If replacement = ng, ng_active = 0 (all NG replaced)

### 4. Remain Calculation

```sql
remain = workable - bonding - ng_active
```

**What it means:**
- **workable** = Material available from cutting
- **bonding** = Already produced in bonding
- **ng_active** = NG that hasn't been replaced yet
- **remain** = Material yang masih bisa dikerjakan bonding

---

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No NG

```
quantityOrder: 1000
workable: 800 (from cutting)
bonding: 500
ng: 0
replacement: 0
ng_active: 0
remain: 300 (800 - 500 - 0)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Cutting produced 800 units
- Bonding completed 500 units
- No NG/reject
- 300 units remaining to be bonded

### Scenario 2: NG Without Replacement

```
quantityOrder: 1000
workable: 800
bonding: 500
ng: 50
replacement: 0
ng_active: 50 (50 - 0)
remain: 250 (800 - 500 - 50)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Cutting produced 800 units
- Bonding completed 500 units
- 50 units NG (defect)
- No replacement yet
- Only 250 units remaining (workable reduced by NG)

### Scenario 3: NG With Partial Replacement

```
quantityOrder: 1000
workable: 800
bonding: 500
ng: 50
replacement: 30
ng_active: 20 (50 - 30)
remain: 280 (800 - 500 - 20)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Cutting produced 800 units
- Bonding completed 500 units
- 50 units NG
- 30 units already replaced by cutting
- 20 units NG still active (not replaced)
- 280 units remaining (workable reduced by active NG only)

### Scenario 4: NG Fully Replaced

```
quantityOrder: 1000
workable: 800
bonding: 500
ng: 50
replacement: 50
ng_active: 0 (50 - 50)
remain: 300 (800 - 500 - 0)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Cutting produced 800 units
- Bonding completed 500 units
- 50 units NG
- All 50 units replaced by cutting
- No active NG
- 300 units remaining (back to normal)

## üîç Query Examples

### Get All Workable with NG Info

ORDER BY ng DESC;
```

### Get Workable Detail with NG

```sql
SELECT 
  customerPO,
  shipToName,
  sku,
  "Layer 1",
  "Layer 2",
  "Layer 3",

## üîÑ Integration with Workflow

### Complete Flow

```
1. Cutting produces material
   ‚Üì
   workable = min(all layers)
   
2. Bonding produces units
   ‚Üì
   bonding += quantity
   remain = workable - bonding
   
3. NG detected in bonding
   ‚Üì
   ng += ng_quantity
   ng_active = ng - replacement
   remain = workable - bonding - ng_active
   
4. Replacement request created
   ‚Üì
   Status: PENDING
   
5. Cutting processes replacement
   ‚Üì
   replacement += processed_qty
   ng_active = ng - replacement
   remain = workable - bonding - ng_active
   
6. Replacement completed
   ‚Üì
   replacement = ng
   ng_active = 0
   remain = workable - bonding (back to normal)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: NG not showing in view

**Check:**
1. Verify `bonding_reject` table has data
2. Check status is not 'CANCELLED'
3. Verify customer_po and sku match

### Issue: Replacement not reducing NG

**Check:**
1. Verify `replacement_progress` linked to `bonding_reject`
2. Check replacement status is 'IN_PROGRESS' or 'COMPLETED'
3. Verify processed_qty > 0

### Issue: Remain calculation incorrect

**Check:**
1. Verify workable calculation (min of all layers)
2. Check bonding total
3. Verify ng_active = ng - replacement
4. Check formula: remain = workable - bonding - ng_active
